# React Notes App
The React Notes App is a simple web application built with React.js that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing your personal notes, making it easy to keep track of your thoughts, ideas, and to-do lists.

## Features
- **Create Notes:** Easily create new notes by clicking on the "Add Note" button. Give your note a title and add content to save it instantly.

- **Edit and Delete:** Edit your notes whenever you want by clicking on the note's title or content. You can also delete any note you no longer need.

- **Organize with Categories:** Categorize your notes for better organization. Create, edit, and delete categories as needed.

- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific notes using the search bar. The app will display notes containing your search query.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work seamlessly across different devices, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

## Demo

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
